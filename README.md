### Hey, I'm Andy

Founder at [Instructionly](https://instructionly.io) — One rulebook for every AI

18+ years in software engineering, 6 leading teams. Now making sure AI follows your team's playbook.

#### What I'm building

AI assistants are powerful, but without guidance they produce inconsistent code. Teams lose knowledge between sessions and waste time correcting the same mistakes.

The workaround? Dumping huge instruction files into every prompt—bloating context and burning tokens.

Instructionly fixes this—we let teams centralize coding standards and deliver them on-demand to any AI tool. Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT, and anything supporting MCP.
